Before you judge a relationship based on something you think, make sure you're right. It would be a shame to create trouble where there isn't any or see damage in a matter that can be resolved through conversation.",

If you are uncertain about where to go next and you can't seem to come up with an answer on your own, put your question out there. Ask it out loud. Do so with hope and joy. And then let it go.

      "Monday": "When you travel outside of your comfort zone, it can bring feelings of unease and apprehension. That's because you no longer know what to expect, because you have entered into unfamiliar territory. But don't let that stop you from trying something new or different today, Capricorn. While you may experience those feelings of discomfort, they won't last. Once you acclimate yourself, you will begin to feel more confident, and you'll know you did the right thing.",
      "Tuesday": "No one is loved by everyone. Our political leanings, our beliefs, our backgrounds, our past experiences - all of these and more can influence how other people feel about us. And when you hide those things in order to fit in, Capricorn, they aren't loving you or hating you for who you truly are. Today, try to be more of your genuine self. There is only one of you, and you are special. Don't lose that because you want someone to approve. By being your true self, you will attract true friends and allies.",
      "Wednesday": "We often think of romantic relationships as needing an occasional date night and private moments together to keep the flame burning. It's a good way to keep the romance from getting stale. But this can also be true, for other relations as well, such as any non-romantic relationship. If you have a bond that has become dull or you have grown apart, sometimes sharing an interest together or doing something fun could get you back on track again. All relationships need maintenance, Capricorn.",

They may have aspirations that they are passionate about, but you may not have the connections you wish you had to help propel them forward. But what you do have, Aquarius, is so valuable. You have a bright smile a warm hug, kind words of encouragement, and so much more. Give what you have generously. It is far more valuable than you realize.",
      "Tuesday": "You are a lot pickier than some of the people in your social group, Aquarius. They may even see you as fickle. But if you differ on this very fact, then why would it bother you that they see you in this way? You have to be who you are, no matter what anyone else thinks. If you are being selective about something now and other people don't understand, they don't have to live with your choices, anyway. Stick to what makes you feel right and good, and you can't go wrong.",
      "Wednesday": "You need to start knocking down a wall that sits between you and someone you care about. That wall has not always been there. In fact, it may have sprung up so slowly that you didn't even notice how big it had become. It may have started with a small misunderstanding, and after that, it just kept going. But you can knock it down, and you should. First, start reminiscing about the good times you had. Then remove a brick. You can do it slowly, and soon you'll see why it was such a wise thing to do. ",

      "Monday": "You could easily be dragged down today by the problems someone you care about is experiencing. But since your goal is to help, Pisces, you can't let that happen. If you descend to that level, you won't be as good at inspiring and supporting as you want to be, plus you'll be caught in the same low place. You have so much to give, and it is natural to empathize with someone's sorrow or hopelessness, but don't make it your own. The example you provide today - being strong, optimistic, and hopeful - will be a source of strength your loved one can draw on to make a turnaround in their life.",
      "Tuesday": "When you are trying to find your way to a place you have never been, and you don't happen to have a map or a directional device available, you can always ask for directions. But what if the one you stop to ask doesn't really know, and they offer incorrect or incomplete directions? You could wind up lost all over again. When you ask for any kind of advice from the wrong person, Pisces, the same thing can happen. You may be seeking wisdom and guidance now. You can find it if you are selective about where you seek it.",
      "Wednesday": "To some people, public speaking comes naturally. They get out in front of an audience eager to share what they know, and their adrenaline rushes at the sound of applause and laughter. You may not see yourself as one of those people, Pisces, but with your creativity and insight, you could certainly put on a great presentation. If you happen to find yourself in that role now or soon, just concentrate on what you're talking about rather than on being entertaining. Remember that you have something very valuable to share.",
